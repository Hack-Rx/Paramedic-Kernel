# Paramedic-Kernel Covid-19 Symptom tracker

A new Flutter project for Bajaj Health Rx hackathon.


## Objective

We built an app that would allow users to methodically log in their symptoms on a daily basis. The app stores the symptoms of the user in Google Sheets. We then retrieve the data from the spreadsheet in order to plot a point-line graph, which helps visualise the symptom trend of the user.


### Further additions

While doing this project, we found it very difficult to find patient data wherein their symptoms would be listed, and their test result whether they were corona virus positive or not. 
To help the open source community, we wish to provide such data in a privacy complaint manner. Hence we have stored our user symptom data in Google Sheets, through which we can later publish the data in csv format. We will anonymise the user data before publishing it.
